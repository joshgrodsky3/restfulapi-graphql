# restfulapi-graphql

RESTful API driven webapp similar to facebook wall posting.

graphQl backend, React front-end.
-- extremely fast and simple, graphQl makes data passing really easy to understand and I had previously worked with React in my react native app.


--Note: react structure not written by me, the relationship with the backend is however.
